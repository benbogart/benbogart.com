                <p class="Heading"><a name="bio" id="bio"></a>Ben Bogart's Bio</p>
                <p class="Info">Ben Bogart was first introduced to the brassy, penetrating sounds of the saxophone at age 9 and was invited to become a member of the local high school concert, jazz, and marching bands by the 7th grade. By age 13, he was already writing music and arranging many first compositions for his own saxophone quartet.</p>
                <p class="Info">At 16, Ben spent several months in Uglich, Russia, as part of an exchange program. There, his passion for music inspired him to learn to play the guitar. He obsessively practiced for 5 or more hours a day, and even repaired guitars and an electric bass to start his first rock band.</p>
                <p class="Info">Although guitar remained a personal interest, Ben decided to pursue a music degree at the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1999, and declared saxophone as his principal instrument.</p>
                <p class="Info">After studying at UCSC Ben was fortunate enough to study under Ray Brown, a trumpet player in Capitola California, in order to solidify his improvisational skills in Jazz. Ben studied with Ray Brown for one year before moving to Boston to attend the Berklee College of Music where he pursued private instruction from George Garzone. George inspired Ben to find his true musical passion, improvisation.</p>
                <p class="Info">The improvisational ensemble Third Nipple was formed for Ben&rsquo;s final project at Berklee. The band is still his predominant musical project. He also plays with The Boston Jazz Trio and as a freelance musician. Besides trumpet and guitar, his other musical interests include the piano, flute and clarinet. In addition, he teaches Saxophone Lessons both privately and at the Boston Center for Adult Education.</p>
                <p class="Info">With an irrepressible passion for music, Ben was inevitably drawn to dance while at UCSC. He took up dancing as another way to express himself musically.Ben was introduced to the expressive Argentine Tango in which he has found an gratifying outlet for both physical and musical improvisation.</p></td>
