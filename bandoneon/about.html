                <p class="Heading"><a name="bio" id="bio"></a>Ben Bogart's Bio</p>
                <p class="Info">Ben Bogart was first introduced to the brassy, penetrating sounds of the saxophone at age 9 and was invited to become a member of the local high school concert, jazz, and marching bands by the 7th grade. By age 13, he was already writing music and arranging many first compositions for his own saxophone quartet.</p>
                <p class="Info">At 16, Ben spent a year in Uglich, Russia, as part of an exchange program. There, his passion for music inspired him to learn to play the guitar. He obsessively practiced for 5 or more hours a day, and even repaired guitars and an electric bass to start his first rock band.</p>
                <p class="Info">After returning from Russia, Ben decided to pursue a music degree at the University of California Santa Cruz in 1999, and declared saxophone as his principal instrument.</p>
                <p class="Info">After studying at UCSC Ben was fortunate enough to study under Ray Brown, a trumpet player in Capitola California, in order to solidify his improvisational skills in Jazz. Ben studied with Ray Brown for one year before moving to Boston to attend the Berklee College of Music where he pursued private instruction from George Garzone. George inspired Ben to find his true musical passion, free improvisation.</p>
                <p class="Info">Several years later a student of Ben's put a Bandone&oacute;n in his hands and he had to play it. After a couple years of independent study in the US he moved to Buenos Aires to pursue the instrument full time. He now plays with the Orquesta Escuela de Tango de Emilo Balcarce and studies with the Carlos L&aacute;zzari (1st Bando D'Arienzo), Nestor Marconi, and Rodolfo Medeos. He has shared the stage with Leopoldo Federico, Nestor Marconi, Leonardo Marconi, Hugo Marcel, Virginia Luque, among others.</p>
